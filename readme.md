1. What is the difference between **getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll**?

 A. etElementById:  Selects a single element based on its unique id attribute. This is the most  specific and efficient selection method when targeting a known element by its ID.

B.getElementsByClassName:  Selects all elements that possess a specific class name.

C.uerySelector :  Selects the first element that matches a given CSS selector. This allows for flexible selection using any valid CSS selector syntax (e.g., #id, .class, tag, [attribute], or combinations thereof). 


D.querySelectorAll:  Selects all elements that match a given CSS selector, similar to querySelector but returning all matches instead of just the first.
